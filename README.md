# KNN-ALGORITHM-PART-1-
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a classification task using Python.
The notebook explores how different values of k and distance metrics affect model performance.

🧠 What is KNN?

KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset

Preprocessed the data

Applied feature scaling

Trained KNN models with different values of k

Evaluated model performance using accuracy

Compared results for different configurations

🔍 Key Observations

Small values of k (like k = 1) lead to overfitting

Larger values of k produce smoother and more stable predictions

A moderate k value (around 5) gives the best balance between bias and variance

Distance metrics affect neighbor selection and accuracy

Feature scaling is important for distance-based models

✅ Best Model Configuration

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors

k value: 5

Distance metric: Euclidean

Scaling: Applied

This configuration provided good accuracy and stable predictions.
